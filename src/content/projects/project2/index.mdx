* Payload subsystem designed to determine soil quality for the agricultural industry
* Used various sensors to determine distance from ground, air quality, UV light, temperature and humidity.
* Used circuit analysis to wire payload and wrote C code to program the payload to complete the desired task via Arduino IDE
* Designed excel macros to compute if the data retrieved from the payload is sufficient for plant growth
* 3-D printed a monocoque chassis for the payload that was able to withstand expected forces and stresses
