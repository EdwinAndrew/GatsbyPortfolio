This project will provide a brief glimpse into data manipulation and visualization in Jupyter Notebooks. Using pokemon data, various parameters will be tested and compared to find the best and worst pokemon in each class. This data set includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.
