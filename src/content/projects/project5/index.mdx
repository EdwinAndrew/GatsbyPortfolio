* Prioritized and assigned work to a team of seven to support project schedule
* Simulated a 3-DOF model of the drone to test trajectory, PID performance, and flight performance on Simulink
* Designed the control system of the drone via MATLAB and root locus
* Performed sensor data acquisition, signal filtering and analysis to create a more precise simulation of the system
* Implemented signal processing and basic computer vision techniques to track the drones position
* Designed automated flight control for aerial drilling using Stateflow in Simulink
